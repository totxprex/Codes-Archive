// let billvalue = 275
// let result = billvalue >= 50 && billvalue <= 300 ? 15 / 100 * billvalue : 20 / 100 * billvalue
// console.log(result)
// console.log(`The bill was ${billvalue}, and the tip was ${result}, and the total value is ${billvalue + result}`)

// let billvalue = 40
// let result = billvalue >= 50 && billvalue <= 300 ? 15 / 100 * billvalue : 20 / 100 * billvalue
// console.log(result)
// console.log(`The bill was ${billvalue}, and the tip was ${result}, and the total value is ${billvalue + result}`)

// let billvalue = 430
// let result = billvalue >= 50 && billvalue <= 300 ? 15 / 100 * billvalue : 20 / 100 * billvalue
// console.log(result)
// console.log(`The bill was ${billvalue}, and the tip was ${result}, and the total value is ${billvalue + result}`)

// the above is using terneray condition operator to find the tip value. if the bill pages is greater than or equal to 50 and less than or equal to 300, then we instructed JS to save the value of 15% of billvalue to the variable 'result'. If the condition set is not true, we have asked JS to instead save the value of 20% of the bill value to variable 'result'.
// And then we logged the result in a 'string' value type in the console.
